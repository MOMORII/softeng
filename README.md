## Repository Information
This repository contains the group coursework, which will intend to produce a full-stack dynamic web application focusing on the element of 'GAME TIPS & TRICKS', in addition to a PDF report, detailing additional information about our project's planned objectives & target goals. Using a Kanban board, we have allocated tasks between us fairly and equally amongst ourselves. This board contains the product backlog, which will be updated with additional tasks according to the immediate sprint checklist—ensuring we prioritize the current sprint’s deadlines before moving on to the next. 

## Project Overview
The following information will serve to summarise project information in accordance with the assignment brief and the group project requirements outlined in the 'Software Engineering' module guideline PDFs.

### Team Member Roles:
- Keisha - Product Owner
- Anderson - Scrum Master
- Angelo & Rohan - Developers

### Project Summary
"GAME TIPS & TRICKS" is a full-stack dynamic web application designed to create a collaborative space, where gamers can share and discover different strategies, techniques, and insights for the various mainstream games they're passionate about. This platform aims to encourage knowledge exchange and community-driven learning, aligning with the theme of “Sharing, Exchange, and Mutual Aid.”

### Core Features
1. A **searchable database of user-submitted game tips and tricks**, categorised by game and genre
2. **Community-driven rating and feedback system** to ensure the quality and relevance of all user submissions 
3. **User authentication** and **user profiles** to track an individual's contributions and engagement
4. **Gamification elements** (e.g., community badges, leaderboard scores, and a point system) to encourage active user participation
5. A **visually-appealing and user-friendly interface** that remains both aesthetically attractive & easy to navigate across various devices

### Technology Stack
This will establish the technologies that will be using to model our current progress, team communication, and develop our project to the fullest.

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PUG templating system
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL database
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- **Project Management**: GitHub Project

### Development Approach
We are following the 'Scrum' methodology, using GitHub Project for task management and sprint tracking. Our team aims to maintain communications through a WhatsApp groupchat for quick updates on current progress, and, 'Microsoft Teams' for weekly team meetings.

## Persona 
To better understand our target audience and intended user demographic, we have created and reformatted three different user personas into a structured table layout, orginising the details into section that includes Name, Age, Occupation, Goals, Frustration, Wishes, and Scenario. 

## Ethical Issues
In developing the “Game Tips & Tricks” web application, several ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure the platform remains a responsible and fair digital space for users.

### Data Privacy & Security  
Since the platform will involve user authentication and profile tracking, it is essential to implement strong security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse (Schneier, 2020). The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws must be adhered to to safeguard personal information (European Parliament, 2016).

### Intellectual Property & Copyright
The platform relies on user-generated content, raising concerns about the unauthorized sharing of copyrighted material. Ensuring users submit original content and properly attribute external sources is critical to prevent legal disputes (Lessig, 2004). Implementing terms of use that explicitly outline content ownership and copyright policies will help mitigate this risk.

### User Moderation & Ethical Content Management 
As a community-driven platform, there is a risk of users posting misleading, offensive, or harmful content. Ethical content moderation strategies, including automated filtering, user reporting mechanisms, and human moderation, should be established to uphold a respectful and inclusive environment (Gillespie, 2018).

### Fairness & Anti-Toxicity Measures 
Gaming communities can sometimes foster toxic behavior, such as harassment or discrimination. To promote fairness and inclusivity, the platform should implement clear community guidelines and an effective reporting system for inappropriate behavior (Kowert, 2020).

### Gamification & Ethical User Engagement
The implementation of leaderboards, point systems, and badges must be carefully designed to avoid fostering addictive behaviors or excessive competition. Ethical gamification practices should encourage healthy engagement rather than exploit users’ psychological triggers for profit (Zagal & Tomuro, 2013).
By addressing these ethical concerns, the Game Tips & Tricks platform can create a responsible, safe, and engaging environment for gamers while adhering to digital ethics and best practices.

## Kanban board
This is the Kanban board we use to track progress, organize tasks, and ensure smooth workflow management. Each column represents a different stage of the process, helping us visualize work in progress and prioritize tasks effectively. [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/MOMORII/projects/2/views/1)

## Conclusion
As a team, we were able to effectively distribute task responsibilities and successfully complete the Sprint 1 checklist objectives outlined in the coursework brief. Through clear and consistent communication via WhatsApp and Microsoft Teams, we utilised GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Docker to achieve our development goals efficiently.
