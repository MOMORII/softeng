## Project Overview
This repository contains the group coursework, which will intend to produce a full-stack dynamic web application focusing on the element of 'game tips and tricks' and a PDF report, detailing additional information about our project's planned objectives & target goals. Using a Kanban board, we have allocated tasks between us fairly and equally amongst ourselves. We aim to regularly host team meetings via Teams, maintain communications through a Whatsapp groupchat, and demonstrate our collaborative efforts via GitHub.
